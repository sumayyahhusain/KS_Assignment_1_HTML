    <h2>Education</h2>
    
    <p>I attended Howard University in Washington, DC. There I studied Computer Science for 
       and was able tto get my Bachelor's of Science. Throughout college, I participated in 
       various software engineering programs and internships.
    </p>
    <p>Towards the last semester of my studies, I realized that I was very interetsed in 
        learning about User Experience Design (UX). After graduation, I enrolled in a UX 
        bootcamp to learn more about the field and better prepare for my future career.
