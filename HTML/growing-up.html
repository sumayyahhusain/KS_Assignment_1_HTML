    <h2>Growing Up</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Sumayyah Husain. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio with three brothers. When it come to activities, 
        I did a lot in and out of school. I played volleyball, lacrosse, and learned gymnastics. I played the 
        violin for all of middle and high school. I became interested in coding in 10th grade during an 
        "Introduction to Computer Science" required course but have loved it ever sense.
